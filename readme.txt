This is a note about learning GIT
-- Starting from 2014-8-31

1. The procedure of updating files stored should be like this: 
	<1> modify the files
	<2> add file to git (git add xxxx)
	<3> commit the change(git commit -m xxxx)
   Notice that we cannot make the commit before adding the file to the version controlling system.
